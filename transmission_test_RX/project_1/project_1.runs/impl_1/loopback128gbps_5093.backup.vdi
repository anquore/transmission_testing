WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, Map0clk/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clkp_i 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'Map0clk/clk200_i' is not directly connected to top level port. 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' is ignored by Vivado but preserved for implementation tool.
